# bitcoin-python-chatbot

A Chatbot experiment as a Bitcoin expert.

## Installation

You will need to install Python, probably version 3.8 .  Then,

    curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
    python get-pip.py

    pip install python-dotenv

Create a .env file containing your OpenAI Playground Developer account API key.

    # .env file
    OPENAI_API_KEY=xyz....xyz

Then , start JupyterLab:

    pip install jupyterlab
    jupyter-lab

Once inside, you should see the .ipynb project file to open.


## Instructions

Run each step in the notebook, one by one, until you reach the chatbot at the bottom.


## Plans

Ideas to enhance this project:

* Create additional index files from other sources.  See "Llama Hub" for more integrations."
** Create one .ipynb file per data source?
* Create a single page HTML app to host this chatbot.  Needs a domain name.
* Refine, cleanup, enhance, in general.
